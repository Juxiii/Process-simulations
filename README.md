# Process-simulations
Made in Python. Requires module graphics.py by John Zelle.

Algorithms in simulations:
- FCFS
- LCFS
- Round robin
- SJF

Adding processes can be done by:
- User input
- Loading from file
- Generated randomly

Since usually there can be hundreds of processes, the chart can be explored via "wasd" (Loading is slow but I will optimize it some day).
To close chart press "q".
